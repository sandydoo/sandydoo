## Hi there! 👋

I’m Sander (_he / him_) — a software engineer and trained data scientist.

## 👀 I’m looking for permanent work!

#### You can hire me! [My CV is available here.](https://github.com/sandydoo/resume/releases/latest/download/cv.pdf)

I’m looking to join a team of kind and compassionate people who take pride in what they do and strive to leave things a little better than the way they found them. I have a knack for tacking gnarly problems, often way outside of my comfort zone, and I strongly value code maintainability and safety, through static typing and abundant testing.

#### What’s your tech stack?

My favourite languages these days are __Haskell, Elm, Rust, or anything similarly typed and functional__ (see the projects below), but I also know way too much about browsers and __JavaScript__, and have previously worked with __Python__ and __Ruby__.

__Nix__ is my preferred way to manage dependencies and build environments on Linux and MacOS. I’m familiar with most of the cloud offerings, i.e. AWS, and what it takes to set up and secure such services.

#### What are your interests?

Compilers; programming language design, particularly UX and non text-based languages; category theory, especially Voedodsky’s homotopy theory.
Lately, I’ve been enjoying digging into low-level graphics APIs.

#### What else should we know?

I’m a __native English speaker__, fluent in Russian, and can order food in German and Italian.

I currently __work remotely (UTC +4)__, but I’m looking to __relocate to Deutschland / EU.__

My ground rules are:

- __Do no evil.__ Is your business exploiting, manipulating, or hurting people?
  No, thanks. Same thing goes for the environment.

- __Riddle me this.__ Is your hiring process a series of copy-pasted brainteasers that are entirely unrepresentative of an average day’s work? Also, no thanks!

An ode to the macOS Drift screensaver that runs in the browser. Built on WebGL2 and WebAssembly, and written in Rust.

#### [PolarClockElm](https://github.com/sandydoo/PolarClockElm)
A colourful animated clock in polar coordinates built in Elm. Complex animated
SVG paths and colour interpolation galore.

#### [CubehelixExplained](https://github.com/sandydoo/CubehelixExplained)
A write-up of the mathematics behind the “cubehelix” colour space.

#### [Ember Google Maps](https://github.com/sandydoo/ember-google-maps)
I still maintain this addon from my days as an [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) developer.
It’s arguably the most pleasant way of working with Google Maps,
and is consistently in the [Top \#50 of Ember addons](https://emberobserver.com/lists/top-addons).

## 🎓 Education

#### MSc Applied Statistics, University of Oxford, 2016

What’s “Applied Statistics”? It’s statistical theory, the mathematics of
uncertainty, applied to data: from data visualisation and linear regression, all
the way to computationally intensive Bayesian methods and machine learning.
