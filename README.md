## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
Iâ€™m Sander (_he / him_) â€” a software engineer and trained data scientist. I make random things and post them on the internet. Some of them are, like, cool.

## âœ¨ Things Iâ€™ve made

#### [Flux](https://github.com/sandydoo/flux)
An open-source tribute to the macOS Drift screensaver that runs in the browser.
Flux is a cross-platform GPU-based fluid simulation written in Rust and features an interactive web UI built with Elm.

#### [PolarClockElm](https://github.com/sandydoo/PolarClockElm)
A colourful animated clock in polar coordinates built with Elm. Complex animated
SVG paths and colour interpolation galore.

#### [Ember Google Maps](https://github.com/sandydoo/ember-google-maps)
I still maintain this addon from my days as an [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) developer.
Itâ€™s arguably the most pleasant way of working with Google Maps,
and is consistently in the [Top \#50 of Ember addons](https://emberobserver.com/lists/top-addons).
