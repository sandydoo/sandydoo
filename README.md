## üëã Hi there!
I‚Äôm Sander (_he / him_) ‚Äî a software engineer and trained data scientist. I make random things and post them on the internet. Some of them are, like, cool.

## ‚ú® Things I‚Äôve made

#### [Flux](https://github.com/sandydoo/flux)
An open-source tribute to the macOS Drift screensaver that runs in the browser.

Flux is a cross-platform GPU-based fluid simulation written in Rust. It features an interactive web UI built with Elm.
I‚Äôm also working on [native screensaver versions](https://github.com/sandydoo/flux-screensavers) for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

#### [PolarClockElm](https://github.com/sandydoo/PolarClockElm)
A colourful animated clock in polar coordinates built with Elm. Complex animated
SVG paths and colour interpolation galore.

#### [CubehelixExplained](https://github.com/sandydoo/CubehelixExplained)
A write-up of the mathematics behind the ‚Äúcubehelix‚Äù colour space.

#### [Ember Google Maps](https://github.com/sandydoo/ember-google-maps)
I still maintain this addon from my days as an [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) developer.
It‚Äôs arguably the most pleasant way of working with Google Maps,
and is consistently in the [Top \#50 of Ember addons](https://emberobserver.com/lists/top-addons).
