## Hey there, internet voyager! 👋

I’m Sander ( _he / him_ ) — a programmer and trained data scientist, <br>
poking at the language design and user interface dragons <br>
with the sticks of category theory and topology.

<br>


## 🔭 Right now

I’m working on a long-term research project, designing a different type of
programming language. It’s not _your-favourite-language-but-with-a-twist_, and
it’s not a _connect-boxes-with-wires_ thing. Behind the scenes, it’s based on
shapes, patterns, types, categories, and proofs.

I’d like to make computer programming more accessible and friendly, so that _you
too can code_. In the meantime, maybe we can make programming safer and a bit
more pleasant for the professional developers.

<br>


## 👷 Work

I’m open to opportunities to work with kind and compassionate folk on fun
problems, preferably in __Haskell__, __Elm__, or something similar.

Remote ( I’m on GMT +3 ) or relocation to Deutschland.

A few ground rules, though:

- __Do no evil.__ Is your business exploiting, manipulating, or hurting people?
  No, thanks. Same thing goes for the environment.

- __Riddle me this.__ I’m not interested in solving brainteasers on the spot —
  especially on a whiteboard. I realise that hiring people is hard, but this is
  not the way.

I try to post my projects on GitHub with liberal licenses.

Some of my recent projects:

- [sandydoo/PolarClockElm](https://github.com/sandydoo/PolarClockElm)

  A colourful animated clock in polar coordinates built in Elm. Complex animated
  SVG paths and colour interpolation galore.

- [sandydoo/CubehelixExplained](https://github.com/sandydoo/CubehelixExplained)

  A write-up of the mathematics behind the “cubehelix” colour space.

- [sandydoo/MullvadConfigs](https://github.com/sandydoo/MullvadConfigs)

  A utility to generate Wireguard configurations for the Mullvad VPN service
  written in Haskell.

- [sandydoo/ember-google-maps](https://github.com/sandydoo/ember-google-maps)

  I still maintain this addon from this my days as an [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) developer.
  It’s arguably the most pleasant way of working with Google Maps,
  and is consistently in the
  [Top #100 of Ember addons](https://emberobserver.com/lists/top-addons).

## 🎓 Education

#### MSc Applied Statistics, University of Oxford, 2016

What’s “Applied Statistics”? It’s statistical theory, the mathematics of
uncertainty, applied to data: from data visualisation and linear regression, all
the way to computationally intensive Bayesian methods and machine learning.
